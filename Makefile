# This makefile runs the tests as Travis runs them.  Be sure to test
# locally before you push if you are under the impression that the
# patch should work.  This will cut down on the number of commits in
# the repository that, essentially, patch patches.
#
# To test Emacs 24.1, for example, use
#
#     make 1
#
# To test on all versions, of course, simply use
#
#     make
#
# or
#
#     make all
