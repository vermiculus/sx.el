;;; Commentary:

;; This file handles logic related to authentication.  This includes
;; determining if a certain filter requires authentication (via the
;; variable `sx-auth-filter-auth' and function `sx-auth--filter-p'),
;; determining if a method requires authentication (via the variable
;; `sx-auth-method-auth' and function `sx-auth--method-p'), and
;; actually authenticating the user (with `sx-auth-authenticate').

Authentication is required to read your personal data (such as
notifications) and to write with the API (asking and answering
questions).

When this function is called, `browse-url' is used to send the
user to an authorization page managed by StackExchange.  The
following privileges are requested:

* read_inbox
    use SX to manage and visit items in your inbox

* write_acesss
    write comments, ask questions, and post answers on your
    behalf

* no_expiry
    do not pester you to reauthorize again

After authorization with StackExchange, the user is then
redirected to a website managed by SX.  The access token required
to use authenticated methods is included in the hash (which is
