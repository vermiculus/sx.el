;;; Commentary:

;; This file holds a series of functions for performing arbitrary
;; interactions with arbitrary objects (objects here always mean the
;; alist of a question, answer, or comment). All commands take at
;; least a DATA argument corresponding to the object which, when
;; called interactively, is always derived from the context at point
;; (usually using the `sx--data-here' function).
;;
;; Interactions represented here involve voting, commenting, asking,
;; answering, editing.
;;
;; These are commands are meant to be available throughout the
;; interface. So it didn't make sense to put them in a specific
;; module. They also rely on a lot of dependencies, so they couldn't
;; be put in sx.el.
