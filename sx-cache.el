;;; Commentary:

;; This file handles the cache system.  All caches are retrieved and
;; set using symbols.  The symbol should be the sub-package that is
;; using the cache.  For example, `sx-pkg' would use
;;
;;   `(sx-cache-get 'pkg)'
;;
;; This symbol is then converted into a filename within
;; `sx-cache-directory' using `sx-cache-get-file-name'.
;;
;; Currently, the cache is written at every `sx-cache-set', but this
;; write will eventually be done by some write-all function which will
;; be set on an idle timer.
