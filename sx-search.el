;;; Commentary:

;; Implements search functionality.  The basic function is
;; `sx-search-get-questions', which returns an array of questions
;; according to a search term.
;;
;; This also defines a user-level command, `sx-search', which is an
;; interactive wrapper around `sx-search-get-questions' and
;; `sx-question-list-mode'.


;;; Code:

(require 'sx)
(require 'sx-question-list)
(require 'sx-tag)

(defvar sx-search--query-history nil
  "Query history for interactive prompts.")


;;; Basic function
(defun sx-search-get-questions (site page query &optional tags excluded-tags keywords)
  "Like `sx-question-get-questions', but restrict results by a search.

Perform search on SITE.  PAGE is an integer indicating which page
of results to return.  QUERY, TAGS, and EXCLUDED-TAGS restrict the
possible returned questions as per `sx-search'.

Either QUERY or TAGS must be non-nil, or the search will
fail.  EXCLUDED-TAGS is only is used if TAGS is also provided.

KEYWORDS is passed to `sx-method-call'."
