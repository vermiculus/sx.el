;;; Commentary:

;; This file defines `sx-compose-mode' and its auxiliary functions and
;; variables. In order to use `sx-compose-mode', it is vital that the
;; variable `sx-compose--send-function' be set. Otherwise it's just a
;; regular markdown buffer.
;;
;; In order to help avoid mistakes, there is the function
;; `sx-compose-create'. This is the preferred way of activating the
;; mode. It creates a buffer, activates the major mode, and sets the
;; `send-function' variable according to the arguments it is given.
