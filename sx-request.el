;;; Commentary:

;; API requests are handled on three separate tiers:
;;
;; `sx-method-call':
;;
;;    This is the function that should be used most often, since it
;;    runs necessary checks (authentication) and provides basic
;;    processing of the result for consistency.
;;
;; `sx-request-make':
;;
;;    This is the fundamental function for interacting with the API.
;;    It makes no provisions for 'common' usage, but it does ensure
;;    data is retrieved successfully or an appropriate signal is
;;    thrown.
;;
;; `url.el' and `json.el':
;;
;;    The whole solution is built upon `url-retrieve-synchronously'
;;    for making the request and `json-read-from-string' for parsing
;;    it into a properly symbolic data structure.
;;
;; When at all possible, use `sx-method-call'.  There are specialized
;; cases for the use of `sx-request-make' outside of sx-method.el, but
;; these must be well-documented inline with the code.

You should almost certainly be using `sx-method-call' instead of

This defaults to `sx-request-response-get-items'.

The full set of arguments is built with
`sx-request--build-keyword-arguments', prepending
`sx-request-api-key' to receive a higher quota. It will also
include user's `access_token` if it is avaialble. This call is
then resolved with `url-retrieve-synchronously' to a temporary
buffer that it returns.  The headers are then stripped using a
search a blank line (\"\\n\\n\").  The main body of the response
is then tested with `sx-encoding-gzipped-buffer-p' for
compression.  If it is compressed, `sx-request-unzip-program' is
called to uncompress the response.  The uncompressed respons is
then read with `json-read-from-string'.

`sx-request-remaining-api-requests' is updated appropriately and
the main content of the response is returned."
